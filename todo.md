Immediately: make sure all activity tags display accordingly
  -Maybe have a drop down that appears below when hovered over (x)

-I would ideally like on index/show page:
  -photo (x)
  -star button (x)
    - have unicode (not onClick handler)
  -hover off (x, this is stupid)


For tomorrow:
  -Be able to star an adventure from either the show or the index page (index, x)
  -Add a completed element for the starred Adventures
    -Green market for completed (x)
    -Red marker for TODO (x)
    -Need to be able to switch between completed and todo

  -Start basic cloudinary debugging/setup (x)
    -Figure out a way to do this in production rather than polluting the
    global namespace with the Cloudinary Options...


-Fix map flickering
  -Potentially add parent component...

-Use a better google font
  -Something less silly and more legible (sortof)
    -Current font is more readable but I could use a more stylish/sleek font
