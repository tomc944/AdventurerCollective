Immediately: make sure all activity tags display accordingly
  -Maybe have a drop down that appears below when hovered over (x)

-I would ideally like an index show page:
  -photo
  -star button
    - have unicode (not onClick handler)
  -hover off
      -displays activities as glphys


For tomorrow:

  -Add a completed element for the starred Adventures
    -Green market for completed
    -Red marker for TODO

  -Start basic cloudinary debugging/setup (x)

-Fix map flickering
  -Potentially add parent component...

-DEMO USER!!! Need to add this immediately so users can
immediately test out functionality of app...
  - this has been added just needs to be formatted correctly (X)

-Fix heroku issues
  -Buy domain (X)
  -Figure out why the adventures api controllers are not working correctly (x)
  -Figure out relic and pinning (X)

-Use a better google font
  -Something less silly and more legible
