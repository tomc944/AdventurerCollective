Immediately: make sure all activity tags display accordingly
  -Maybe have a drop down that appears below when hovered over (x)

  -Sort of done - may need to overhaul how the adventures are displayed
    -i.e. not in a table
    -Just have a div with an ul and lis for each adventure
    -Bootstrap these elements somehow...
    -I would ideally like an index show page:
        -photo
        -star button
        -hover off
            -displays activities as glphys

For tomorrow:
  -Be able to star an adventure from either the show or the index page
  -Add a completed element for the starred Adventures
    -Green market for completed
    -Red marker for TODO
  -Start basic cloudinary debugging/setup


-Fix map flickering
  -Potentially add parent component...
