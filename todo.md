Immediately: make sure all activity tags display accordingly
  -Maybe have a drop down that appears below when hovered over (x)

-I would ideally like an index show page:
  -photo
  -star button
    - have unicode (not onClick handler)
  -hover off
      -displays activities as glphys


For tomorrow:
  -Be able to star an adventure from either the show or the index page
  -Add a completed element for the starred Adventures
    -Green market for completed (x)
    -Red marker for TODO (x)
    -Need to be able to switch between completed and todo

  -Start basic cloudinary debugging/setup (x)

-Fix map flickering
  -Potentially add parent component...



-Use a better google font
  -Something less silly and more legible
