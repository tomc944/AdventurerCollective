Immediately: make sure all activity tags display accordingly
  -Maybe have a drop down that appears below when hovered over (x)

-I would ideally like an index show page:
  -photo
  -star button
  -hover off
      -displays activities as glphys


For tomorrow:
  -Be able to star an adventure from either the show or the index page
  -Add a completed element for the starred Adventures
    -Green market for completed
    -Red marker for TODO
  -Start basic cloudinary debugging/setup

-Fix map flickering
  -Potentially add parent component...

-Test activity show page functionality...
